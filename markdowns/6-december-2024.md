### JS FUNDAMENTALS
Introduction
- let is a keyword that we use to tell the computer that we want to create a new variable.
- It is then followed by the name of the variable. In this example we chose age.
- Finished first chapter Introduction

Basic operations
- The first time you define a variable, you have to define it with let, however, the next time you use that variable, you should NOT use let anymore; je gebruikt slechts de aangemaakte naam van de variabel
- The + operator telt the 2 numbers on its left and right
- The * operator vermenigvuldigt the 2 numbers on its left and right
- Finished second chapter Basic operations

Basic functions
- The function keyword is used to define a function. This allows you to group related code logic together to make a reusable task. More on that later on.
- This is an important keyword. return is used to give the result of the function.
